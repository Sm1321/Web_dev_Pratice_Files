            1. Class Selector (.)
 The class selector allows you to style elements that have a specific class attribute.
 This is one of the most commonly used selectors in CSS because classes are reusable and can be applied to multiple elements across a webpage.
 How to Use:
 You assign a class to an element by adding the class attribute in the HTML.
 In the CSS, you define the style for that class by prefixing the class name with a dot (.).
 Syntax:
